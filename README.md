# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

This project is part of the Progressive Web Applications (PWA) challenge and involves the development of a web-based text editor that meets the standards of a PWA. A PWA is a web application that utilizes modern technologies to provide a user experience similar to that of a native app, including the ability to function offline. The PWA text editor will allow users to create, edit, and save text documents directly from a web browser, with the capability to access them even when offline.
